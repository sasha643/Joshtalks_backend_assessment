## Project Description

This is a Django-based Task Manager API that allows you to:
- Register users
- Assign tasks to users
- Fetch tasks for a specific user
- Return well-structured error and success responses
- Run with or without Docker

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip
- Docker (If running using docker)
- SQLite

---

## Installation

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sasha643/Joshtalks_backend_assessment.git
cd Joshtalks_backend_assessment
```

## Running the Project

### Running Locally

1. Create and activate virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

4. Create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

5. Run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Running using Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t taskmanager-app .
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 taskmanager-app
```

**NOTE:** On container start, migrations will be applied automatically via entrypoint.sh and superuser will be created with credentials:  

username: admin  
email: admin@gmail.com  
password: admin123

    "mobile": "9876543210"
  }
}
```

```bash
{
    "reason": "Created",
    "message": "Task created successfully"

}
```

#### Response Body:

```bash
{
    "reason": "OK",
    "message": "Task assigned successfully"
}
```

### 4. Get Tasks for a Specific User

**GET** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/tasks/users/<int:user_id>`

#### Response Body:

```bash
{
    "reason": "OK",
    "message": "Tasks fetched successfully",
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "description": "Deploy the backend"

**NOTE**:
If you're running the application using Docker, replace 127.0.0.1 with localhost in the API URLs.
Example:
```http://127.0.0.1:8000 ``` â†’ ```http://localhost:8000 ```


## Conclusion

The APIs in this project are properly versioned under ```/api/v1/```, ensuring future scalability and backward compatibility.

For further optimization and enhancement, consider the following:

- Implementing **pagination** for endpoints like Get Tasks, especially when the task list grows large.
- Adding **token-based authentication** (e.g., JWT or session-based auth) to secure API access and associate data with authenticated users.

These improvements will make the API more robust, secure, and production-ready.
